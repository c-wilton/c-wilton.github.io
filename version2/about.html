                <h2 id="backgorund">Pre-computing life</h2>
                <p>During my GCSEs and A-levels, I was never sure about what I wanted to do after school.
                    Going to University and getting student finance didn’t make sense to me when there was no overall goal to aim for.
                    After my levels A-Ievels I did a year motor vehicle before getting a job in manufacturing engineering for almost 10 years.

                <h2>My introduction to computing</h2>
                <p>My first experience with computing languages was when I saw my yahoo account came with Geocities (Wow that’s a blast from the past, right), 
                    which allowed you to create your own webpage for no cost, so I thought I’d give it a go. 
                    I started by using the website builder, but had to use the help feature to find out a few things including how to edit the hex color of an item in the html tab. 
                    Whilst doing that, I realized that the code created to build the website seemed to make sense.
                    It was around this time when I had started Batala Batala (link to the <a href="http://www.batalabangor.com" target="_blank">band's website</a>) which didn’t have a website. 
                    So I thought I would learn more about html using geocities help and quackit tutorials and try to create one.

                <h2>Turning computing into a career</h2>
                <p>Deciding to leave my job to pursue a career in computing with only a basic understanding of html as a background of the field was quite a daunting choice. 
                    However, an Associates Degree included a vast range of modules from Maths and English to Business and Accounting which meant should the subject major not be suitable, 
                    it allows a much easier switch to another major. 
                    So I decided started an Associates Degree and found that I was suited to the field of computing and then transferred to the University of Liverpool to do a BSc in software development which I graduated with a first-class honors.
                    I am now continuing my studies to do a MSc in Computing.
